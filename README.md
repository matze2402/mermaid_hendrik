# Tools vor visualizing and modifying LinkML via CSV templates

This is a GitHub repo which should have all tools for generating a Mermaid representation of an Schema which is defined in CSV files as well as generating the respective LinkML and SHACL schema out of it.
A representation of the schema can be found down below:

To modify this schema, just modify the CSV files of the respective classes.
The readme should update the Diagramm via a GitHub action itself.

This text will prove that Matthias Gacka did it!!!!!!!!!!
